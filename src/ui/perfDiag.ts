 *
 *   ?gpu        GPU line per pass (world, arms, sRGB output, FXAA…) + the
 *               per-section CPU split of the Hitch line
 *   ?gpu=draws  the GPU line per draw category instead (map, sky, snow,
 *               halos, bots…) — what `perfDebug.gpu(true)` does in DEV
 *   ?gpu=off    neither (DEV builds have the per-pass line by default)
 *
 * The GPU line needs EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2 (Chrome / Edge on
 * desktop); without it, it says so. The per-draw split costs a timer query
 * per change of category: measure with it, play without it.

 *
 *   empty    no 3D render at all (simulation, HUD, audio… still run): what
 *            is left is the page's own cost (HUD, browser, compositing)
 *   nopost   Givre: the world drawn straight to the canvas — no HDR target,
 *            no output / FXAA pass
 *   scaleNN  the 3D rendered at NN % of its resolution (scale50: a quarter
 *            of the pixels): FPS almost doubling = the frame is fill-bound
 *   cpuNN    NN ms of extra CPU work at the end of each game frame: FPS
 *            unchanged = the CPU and the GPU work in parallel; FPS dropping
 *            by as much = they wait for each other (something serializes)
 *   noflush  no gl.flush() at the pass boundaries (Game.flushGpu): the old
 *            submission, to compare
 *   percomponent  Givre: the single-sided rule of the static map (closed,
 *            outward, ≤ 2 m thin solids drawn FrontSide) applied per
 *            connected component of a mesh, not only per whole mesh
 *            (GivreRenderOptim.closedOutwardThinTriangles) — NOT the same
 *            image to the bit (a few pixels per view): an experiment
 *
 * (Session switches — percomponent: `?diag=<name>` on, `?diag=no<name>`
 * off, see diagSwitch; read once at load.)
 * Several at once: `?diag=noflush,scale50`. Never for normal play.
